# Machine learning algorithm codes from scrach in python
## 1.DecisionTree_RandomForest
* A decision tree is a tree in which each branch node represents a choice between a number of alternatives, and each leaf node represents 
a decision. 
* Random Forest trained with the “bagging” method builds multiple decision trees and merges them together and correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to make random sampled training set
* data : breast cancer prediction, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29
* code reference : https://github.com/tiepvupsu/DecisionTreeID3
* Decision tree's code is tree 1 file and Random Forest's code is tree2 file.
 
## 2.SVM_algorithm
* SVM(Support Vector Machine) constructs a set of hyperplanes to have the largest distance to the nearest training data point of any class.!
* SVMis broadly divided into hard margin(No error cases are allowed), soft margin(Error cases are allowed and penalty) and kernel(Non-linear decision boundary). 
* code reference : SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES SUCCINCTLY by Alexandre Kowalczyk Foreword by Daniel Jebaraj
* this alogrithm is possible in soft margin and kernel.

## 3.deep_neural_network
* deep learning : DNN, CNN, RNN
* code reference : https://github.com/WegraLee/deep-learning-from-scratch-2
