# Machine learning algorithm codes from scrach in python
## 1.DecisionTree_RandomForest
* A decision tree is a tree in which each branch 
node represents a choice between a number 
of alternatives, and each leaf node represents 
a decision.
* Random Forest trained with the “bagging” method builds multiple decision trees and merges them together and correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to make random sampled training set
